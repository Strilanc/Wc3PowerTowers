You may have noticed this map is not locked. That is on purpose.
All I ask that you do, if you edit the map, is change the filename and the description to avoid confusing people and warcraft 3.
Keep in mind that modifications are detected in order to warn people about potential map rigging.
If you can remove the modification detection, good for you! :D
